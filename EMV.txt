EMV:
steps:
1.initilization
2.authentication
3.authorization
4.transaction
5.Termination

Initilization : Terminal selects the application on card and card asks the terminal for DOL data.
then terminal asks card for its authentication abilities.card sends back AIP to terminal.

Authentication: Terminal chooses the highest priority auth method obtained in AIP.available options are: SDA,DDA,CDA.
the result of offline auth  will be set in TVR data object{ like checklist in terminal}

Authorization: Now Terminal looks at CVM list that previosly read from DOL and decides which verification should choose for : txn,offline, online, signature.
and terminal performs the verification and updates in TVR based on Results.

Transaction: now Terminal put together all this info and sends then to issuer in "Bit55" , to do this, it generates : GEN-AC to card and provides all data
depending on results in STEP:3. Terminal ask for ARQC to send Txn online.TC to approve offline  , AAC  to decline offline.
card encrypts all data under issuers CAPK and sign it and send back it to terminal.
If transaction mean to go online, ARQC will be put in DE55:9F26 which is non-refunable and proof geninue and legitimate chip card present for Txn


Termination :  When the results are recieved from issuer,in some cases card wants some data to update its chip floor limit. so Terminal GEN AC2 to card
along with ARPC,TC,AAC that are recieved from issuer . and EMV session gets shutdown
